Script designed to automate the creation of a PSD file template for use within a design pipeline for creating food art. It allows artist to define a specified number of elements and name each one, with grade suffix for organizing different design stages. Script generates the template by creating groups for each food or tableware element, and within each group, it prepares layers dedicated to shape, shadow, light, and details. This structured approach ensures consistency across design files, streamlining the workflow and improving efficiency in multi-stage design processes.
